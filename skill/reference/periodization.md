# Periodization & Progressive Overload

## Macrocycle Structure

Divide the training period into phases:

### 1. Base Phase (40-50% of available time)

- Build aerobic capacity
- Increase volume gradually (max 10% per week)
- Mostly Zone 2 (conversational pace)
- Focus on technique, especially in swimming

### 2. Build Phase (30-40% of available time)

- Introduce intensity (tempo, threshold work)
- Sport-specific workouts
- Race-simulation sessions (brick workouts for tri)
- Peak volume weeks occur here

### 3. Peak/Race-Specific Phase (10-15% of available time)

- Reduce volume, maintain intensity
- Race-pace work
- Course-specific preparation (hills, open water)

### 4. Taper (1-3 weeks depending on event)

- Significant volume reduction (40-60%)
- Maintain some intensity
- Focus on rest, nutrition, mental prep

## Microcycle Structure (Weekly)

Standard week template:

| Day       | Focus                 | Notes                             |
| --------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Monday    | Rest or easy recovery | Active recovery swim/spin OK      |
| Tuesday   | Quality session #1    | Intervals, tempo, speed work      |
| Wednesday | Moderate aerobic      | Steady-state, technique focus     |
| Thursday  | Quality session #2    | Different sport than Tuesday      |
| Friday    | Rest or easy          | Pre-weekend recovery              |
| Saturday  | Long session #1       | Primary endurance builder         |
| Sunday    | Long session #2       | Secondary sport, or brick workout |

## Progressive Overload

**The 10% Rule**: Increase weekly volume by no more than 10% per week—**for athletes building new fitness**.

### Adjust Progression Based on Athletic Foundation

| Foundation Level             | Progression Rate        | Rationale                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| True beginner                | 5-10% per week          | Everything is new; high injury risk  |
| Some experience (1-2 years)  | 10% per week            | Standard progression                 |
| Strong foundation, returning | 10-15% per week         | Body remembers; rebuilding is faster |
| Recent high fitness          | Maintain or small build | Already fit; focus on specificity    |

**Example**: An Ironman finisher who took 3 months off can progress faster than a beginner. Their muscles, tendons, and cardiovascular system have adapted before. Where a beginner might take 20 weeks to reach 10-hour training weeks, someone rebuilding might get there in 10-12 weeks.

**However**: Always validate with the athlete. Time off due to injury requires more caution than time off due to life circumstances.

### 3:1 or 4:1 Loading

- 3 weeks building load, 1 week recovery (reduce volume 30-40%)
- Or 2 weeks building, 1 week recovery for older/injury-prone athletes
- Athletes rebuilding can often handle 3:1; beginners may need 2:1

### Long Session Progression

For a target marathon (42km), build the long run over 12-16 weeks:

```
Week 1:  16km
Week 2:  18km
Week 3:  20km
Week 4:  14km (recovery)
Week 5:  20km
Week 6:  22km
Week 7:  24km
Week 8:  16km (recovery)
...continue to 32-35km peak
```

Never increase the long session by more than 2-3km (running) or 15-20km (cycling) per week.

## Physiological Adaptations: The "Why"

### Why Easy Training Works (Zone 2)

| Adaptation                      | Timeline   | Mechanism                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Increased mitochondrial density | 4-8 weeks  | More cellular powerhouses for aerobic energy |
| Capillarization                 | 6-12 weeks | More blood vessels deliver oxygen to muscles |
| Improved fat oxidation          | 4-6 weeks  | Shifts fuel use from glycogen to fat         |
| Increased stroke volume         | 8-12 weeks | Heart pumps more blood per beat              |
| Type I fiber development        | Ongoing    | Slow-twitch fibers become more efficient     |

Zone 2 is the foundation—never sacrifice it for more intensity.

### Why Threshold Training Works (Zone 4)

| Adaptation                | Timeline  | Mechanism                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Lactate clearance         | 2-4 weeks | Muscles better at processing lactate                |
| Raised lactate threshold  | 4-8 weeks | Sustain higher intensity before lactate accumulates |
| Improved muscle buffering | 3-6 weeks | Tolerate higher lactate levels                      |
| Mental toughness          | Immediate | Learn to sustain "comfortably hard"                 |

### Why VO2max Intervals Work (Zone 5b)

| Adaptation                | Timeline   | Mechanism                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Increased VO2max          | 4-8 weeks  | Maximum oxygen uptake improves     |
| Cardiac output            | 6-12 weeks | Heart pumps more blood per minute  |
| Neuromuscular recruitment | 2-4 weeks  | Better coordination at high speeds |

Use sparingly—1x/week max, requires 48-72hr recovery.

### Adaptation Timelines Summary

| System                       | Time to See Changes | Time to Optimize |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Neuromuscular (coordination) | 1-2 weeks           | 4-6 weeks        |
| Lactate clearance            | 2-4 weeks           | 6-8 weeks        |
| Aerobic enzymes              | 3-4 weeks           | 8-12 weeks       |
| Mitochondrial density        | 4-6 weeks           | 12-16 weeks      |
| Capillarization              | 6-8 weeks           | 16-24 weeks      |
| Cardiac adaptations          | 8-12 weeks          | 24+ weeks        |
| Bone/tendon strength         | 12-24 weeks         | 1-2 years        |

**Implication**: Base phases should be longer than athletes want. Intensity phases should be shorter. The deepest adaptations take months—there are no shortcuts.
