## Session Intensity Distribution (Polarized Model)

For endurance events, 80% of volume should be easy (Zone 1-2), 20% hard (Zone 4+). Avoid excessive Zone 3 "gray zone" training.

| Zone         | % of Weekly Volume | Purpose                       |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1-2 (Easy)   | 75-80%             | Aerobic development, recovery |
| 3 (Moderate) | 5-10%              | Race-specific only            |
| 4-5 (Hard)   | 15-20%             | Stimulus for adaptation       |
